# Minesweeper

My goal with this project is to work on my full-stack skills, starting with the creation of a simple CLI version of Minesweeper and gradually working my way towards a game that can be played online.For now, I've set up 5 milestones for this project, each of them with its own release.

-   [x] CLI (a minesweeper clone)
-   [x] Server (send commands for the server to process and receive game states with the changes applied)
-   [x] DB (persistance; store high scores)
-   [x] Frontend (a website to play the game)
-   [x] Deployment

All milestones have an associated release with a brief description. I've gotten an MVP ready for each of the milestones, and hope to continue to work on this bit by bit, as I come up with new things to try.

## Notes

I did deploy the application, but I still have to figure out some questions in regards to securing the communication through web scockets so for now I'll leave that on the backburner.

## Instructions

```
# CLI
npm run cli

# Client (build)
cd client && npm run build

# Dev
npm run dev

```
