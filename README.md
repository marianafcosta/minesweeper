# Minesweeper

My goal with this project is to work on my full-stack skills, starting with the creation of a simple CLI version of Minesweeper and gradually working my way towards a game that can be played online. For now, I've set up 4 milestones for this project, each of them with its own release.

-   [x] CLI (a minesweeper clone)
-   [ ] API (send commands for the server to process and receive game states with the changes applied)
-   [ ] DB (persistance; store a player's session)
-   [ ] Frontend (a website to play the game)

My plan is to get a MVP ready for all of them, even if the solutions found are not ideal.
